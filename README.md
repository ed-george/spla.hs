spla.hs
=======

A Haskell port of my previous [spla.sh](https://github.com/ed-george/spla.sh) repository.

####What is spla.(sh|hs)?
Splash is a colour library written in Bash (spla.sh) and ported to Haskell (spla.hs) for [numerous reasons](http://edgeorgedev.co.uk/2014/10/06/bash.html). 

It aims to provide RGB/HSV color space functions. 

####Why spla.(sh|hs)?
Because I though it was funny.
